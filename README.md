Python-Scraper-App

This implementation uses the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries in Python:
This implementation takes a list of urls as input, scrapes each one to get the links on the page, and then filters out links that don't belong to articles by checking if they contain the keyword "article". The results are stored in a text file called "article_links.txt".
